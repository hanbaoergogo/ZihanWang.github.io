About me
I am currently a first-year master's student at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). Before becoming a master, I obtained a bachelor's degree at the UESTC during 2020-2024. I'm now interested in LLM security and privacy.

I am very lucky to be advised by [Prof. Hongwei Li](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/lihongwei) and [Prof. Guowen Xu](https://guowen-xu.github.io/), UESTC.
